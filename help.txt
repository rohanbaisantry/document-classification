This is an implementation of document classification using four algorithms: Multinomial Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests and Logistic Regression.
Validation Sore is calculated as ( #correct - #incorrect )/( total )
SVM has shown to have the highest validation score.

Requirements:
	Python 2 or 3
	sklearn python module
	nllk python module and download stop words beforehand if possible
	pickle python module
	sys python module
	pathlib python module
	time python module
	__future__ python module

cachedStopWords = False # list of stop words to remove.
# you can define your own stop words. if "False" it will download from NLTK and use stopwords provided from them. 
# cachedStopwords = stopwords.words("english")

training_file = "trainingdata.txt" # this is the path of training file.

testing_file = "testingdata.txt" # this is the path of the testing file.

save_model_file = "document_classifier.sav" # this is the file in which the model wll be saved in.

save_vectorizer_file = "tfidf_vectorizer.sav" # path of the file to save the vectorizer model in (should be a .sav file)

load_model_status = True # if true it will load the model from the file with the name stored in the variable load_model_from, if flase it will create a new model.

Load_model_from = "document_classifier.sav" # this is the path of the file from which the model will be loaded from.

load_vectorizer_from = "tfidf_vectorizer.sav" # path of the file to load the vectorizer from. if the file does not exist, it will use the tfidf vectoizer from scikit-learn by default.

validation_size = 0.25 # this is the split ratio for training vs validation data. 
-> size(validation_data) = validation_size * size(total_data)

classifier_to_use = "svm" # this is the classifier to use.
# choose from: [ "Multinomialnb", "svm", "random_forest", "logistic_regression"]


ALL of these variables can be found in the main() function

score() function that will calculate the score as 100*(#correct-#incorrect)/(T)

load_test_file() function to load the testing file data given the testing_file would be a certain format

help() function to display help
please note for this function to work you will need the help.txt (path stored in the variable help_file)
which you do have because you're reading this!

document_classifier is a class with the following member functions: __init__(), train(), predict() and save_model()

Format of the training file:
The first line contains the number of lines that will follow.
Each following line will contain a number (1-8), which is the category number. The number will be followed by a space then some space seperated words which is the processed document.

Format of the testing file:
The first line in the input file will contain T the number of documents.
T lines will follow each containing a series of space seperated words which represents the processed document.
